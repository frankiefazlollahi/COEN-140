My SCU Machine Learning/Data Mining course assignments and lab work.

Course Description: Machine learning as a field has become increasingly pervasive, with applications from the Web (search, advertisements, and recommendation) to national security, from analyzing biochemical interactions to traffic and emissions to astrophysics. This course presents an introduction to machine learning and data mining, the study of computing systems that improve their performance through learning from data. This course is designed to cover the main principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning and data mining.
